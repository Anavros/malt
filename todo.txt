Todo:
- Replace hardcoded chars with constants.
- General clean up.

Fix for Release v0.3:
- Inputs with too many positional arguments are silently accepted, should throw error.

Bugs:
- Ints can not be cast from strings shaped like floats, e.g. '1.0'.
    - Cast to float first and then int.
- Comment chars can not be escaped with backslashes or single quotes.
- Preprocessor can't handle nested lists and dicts.
- Proprocessor iterates over files multiple times.
- Tokenizer and preprocessor have duplicate functionality.

Feature Ideas:
- Allow a default value for dict inputs, e.g. take salt -> {salt:1}
- Allow user input to omit brackets in list and dict input, use inference
- Allow commenting on options for detailed help.
- Config option to turn off error messages? or kwarg?
- Infer positional inputs as keyword inputs if they match position.
- Polish and clarify use of global functions.
- Allow raw characters in inputs using backslash escapes. +++
- Optional function to parse argv in same malt syntax.
- Helper functions to make testing easier?
- Allow implicitly given options i.e. autocommands.
