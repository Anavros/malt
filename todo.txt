Todo:
-> Reimplement custom exceptions and custom error messages.
-> Clean up response objects and object module.
-> Clean up todo file and other documents.
-> Polish and clarify use of global functions.

Bugs:
-> Ints can not be cast from strings shaped like floats, e.g. '1.0'.
-> Omitting key in kwarg raises arg len error.

New Features:
-> Tab completion!
-> Helper functions to make testing easier.
-> There should be a built-in help function. e.g. cmd? gives help for cmd.
-> Allow a default value for dict inputs, e.g. take salt -> {salt:1}
-> Allow user input to omit brackets in list and dict input, use inference
-> Allow commenting on options for detailed help.
-> Config option to turn off error messages? or kwarg?
-> Infer positional inputs as keyword inputs if they match position.

Recent Changes:
-> Removed output features.
