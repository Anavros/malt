Bugs:
-> Unknown commands in malt.load()'ed files throw KeyErrors.
-> Special characters are not allowed on input, even in quotes.
-> Helper functions/global functions and error printing is not clear on use.
-> response == str is deprecated, use response.head == str.

New Features:
-> Color printing.
-> Tab completion!
-> Helper functions to make testing easier.
-> Better unit tests.
-> Log levels should print by default, and have to be blacklisted manually.
-> There should be a built-in help function. e.g. cmd? gives help for cmd.
-> Set default logging level per module.
    * If different modules all import malt.log and set their own levels,
    * whichever one is eval'd last will overwrite all other settings.
-> New, simpler fancy interface.
    * Set a persistent header.
    * Always keep the cursor at the bottom.
    * Probably needs to refresh the screen every turn.

Scope (Anti-Features):
-> Malt definitely doesn't need real-time interaction or threading.
    * The screen only updates once per command, and it blocks in input().
-> The blessed interface should be split into a separate project.
    * It complicates things that should really be kept simple.
