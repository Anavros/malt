Bugs:
-> Unknown commands in malt.load()'ed files throw KeyErrors.
-> Special characters are not allowed on input, even in quotes.
-> Helper functions/global functions and error printing is not clear on use.

New Features:
-> Color printing.
-> Tab completion!
-> Helper functions to make testing easier.
-> Better unit tests.
-> Log levels should print by default, and have to be blacklisted manually.
-> There should be a built-in help function. e.g. cmd? gives help for cmd.
-> Put config options in their own module.
