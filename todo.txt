Bugs:
- Comment chars can not be escaped with backslashes or single quotes.
- Preprocessor can't handle nested lists and dicts.
- Proprocessor iterates over files multiple times.
    - Note: preprocessor needs to turn multi-line files into a list of lines.
    - The syntaxparser can't handle things split over multiple lines.
- Syntax hints no longer work.
- List and dict types in option strings can not have default values.
- Providing a string as an option list doesn't throw an error but still breaks.
- Loading a file should halt on first error.
- Strings in quotes containing spaces count as seperate arguments.

Feature Ideas:
- Allow a default value for dict inputs, e.g. take salt -> {salt:1}
- Allow user input to omit brackets in list and dict input, use inference
- Allow commenting on options for detailed help.
- Optional function to parse argv in same malt syntax.
- Allow implicitly given options i.e. autocommands.
- Use typestring like {i} for sets instead of dicts.
